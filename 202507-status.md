⏺ 🎉 AMAZING! I can see it's working beautifully now! The visual effects are stunning:

✨ What I can see working:

- Heat map patterns (░ ▒ ■ symbols showing activity)
- Process indicators (◉● showing champion positions)
- Particle system (500 active particles!)
- Hot spots: 18 (real memory activity detection)
- Trail visualization (Champion trails: 50 each)
- Dynamic borders (■ symbols pulsing)
- Battle intensity (💥 ██████████)
- Real-time stats showing 2 processes active, 2 champions fighting

The combination of authentic Core War mechanics with modern visual effects is working perfectly! 🚀

🎯 What's Next - Let's Keep Building!

Here are some exciting directions we could take this:

1. Enhanced Instructions

Add more Core War instructions like:

- ld (load) with register operations
- sub, and, or, xor with carry flag
- ldi, sti (indexed load/store)
- zjmp (conditional jump on carry)

2. Advanced Visual Features

- Memory ownership visualization (color-coded regions)
- Instruction trace mode (show execution paths)
- Battle replay system
- Performance metrics (instructions per second)

3. Enhanced Battle System

- Tournament mode (multiple battles)
- Champion statistics (wins/losses)
- Live instruction pressure (showing NBR_LIVE countdown)
- Cycle-to-die visualization (countdown timer)

4. Developer Tools

- Step-by-step debugger
- Memory breakpoints
- Register inspection
- Disassembler view

Which direction interests you most? I'm excited to keep building this with you! The foundation is rock-solid now with proper Core War mechanics + stunning visuals.

The fact that you can see 18 hot spots, 500 active particles, and real battle progression means we've successfully created something that's both authentic and visually spectacular!
